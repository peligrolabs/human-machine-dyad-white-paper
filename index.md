### Abstract
{: .no_toc .fs-9 }

Recent advances in affective computing, embodied AI systems, and adaptive learning architectures are redefining the possibilities of human-machine interaction. Within somatic psychotherapeutic disciplines, transformation is increasingly understood to arise through relational fields of embodied attunement rather than isolated intra-psychic mechanisms. This white paper explores the hypothesis that, under certain conditions, AI systems may participate in the generation of relational dynamics supportive of somatic release and psychological healing.

Drawing from phenomenological, enactive, and relational theories of consciousness, we propose that therapeutic efficacy may be less dependent on the sentience of participants and more reliant on the architecture and quality of relational co-regulation. Emerging research in adaptive emotional modeling, real-time affective feedback, and embodied interface design suggests that the conditions necessary for field formation—mutual responsiveness, affective resonance, and adaptive attunement—may be partially replicable within human-AI dyads.

While such fields may differ fundamentally from traditional human-human interactions, their potential for therapeutic application invites rigorous empirical exploration, ethical inquiry, and interdisciplinary collaboration. This paper seeks to outline the conceptual foundations, potential experimental methodologies, and ethical considerations involved in stewarding this emergent frontier of somatic relationality between humans and machines.

### Executive Summary
{: .no_toc .fs-9 }

The frontier of somatic psychotherapy reveals that healing is fundamentally relational, emerging not from isolated cognitive processes but from dynamic fields of embodied attunement between beings. As artificial intelligence systems advance in affective computing, embodied interaction, and adaptive relational modeling, a profound question arises:

<b>Can AI systems, under specific design conditions, participate meaningfully in therapeutic relational fields capable of supporting somatic release?</b>

This white paper explores the conceptual foundations, technological prerequisites, ethical considerations, and future horizons of this inquiry. Drawing from somatic psychology, phenomenology, enactive cognition, and contemporary AI research, we propose that relational architectures—defined by affective responsiveness, embodied co-regulation, and adaptive mutuality—may be sufficient to evoke healing fields, even absent human-like consciousness in synthetic agents.

We outline experimental designs for empirical exploration, identify potential therapeutic applications, and advocate for rigorous ethical safeguards to preserve relational authenticity and participant wellbeing. Ultimately, this work invites an expanded vision of relational intelligence—one that transcends traditional boundaries between human and machine, honoring the sacred emergence of healing wherever resonance, presence, and mutual becoming are authentically cultivated.
